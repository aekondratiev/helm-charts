<h1>Usage</h1>

Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helmâ€™s documentation to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

helm repo add aekondratiev https://diegofnunesbr.github.io/helm-charts/
If you had already added this repo earlier, run helm repo update to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run helm search repo diegofnunesbr to see the charts.

To install the chart:

helm install zabbix diegofnunesbr/zabbix-server
To uninstall the chart:

helm delete zabbix
